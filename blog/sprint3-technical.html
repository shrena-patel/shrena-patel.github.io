                <h4>HTML and CSS analogy</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">It may be a bit of a rogue analogy, but I like to think of HTML and CSS in terms of animals – in particular, a horse and a zebra.</p></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">A horse, for the most part, is a standard, muted colour and has a solid body, but isn’t necessarily anything to write home about in terms of style and flamboyancy.</p></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">Whereas, a zebra has pretty much the same body as a horse, i.e. the same structure, but it has magnificent stripes that clearly sets it apart from a horse. Like someone has taken the body of a horse and painted it to add some style to it.</p></br>
                    <p class="blog__para">This analogy only really works if a horse were to morph into a zebra, but it’s how I think to think about HTML and CSS.</p></br>

                <h4>Control flow and loops</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">The control flow refers to the order in which a computer executes the statements you have written in a JavaScript file. This can be likened to you writing a to-do list and completing each task in the order that they are written on the list.</p></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">To understand loops, you could think of a JavaScript file as a dishwasher. Once you set the dishwasher to wash the dishes, it will carry on executing the loop of ‘wash the dirty dishes for one minute’ until the dishes are clean when the timer stops. You can ‘break’ the loop by stopping the dishwasher and adding another item, then starting the cycle again will let the loop carry on going.</p></br>

                <h4>What is the DOM?</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">The DOM (Document Object Model) can be thought of as the glue that holds HTML, CSS and JavaScript together. The DOM is an object-orientated representation of the HTML web page, and as JavaScript is an object-orientated programming language, we can use JS to interact with the DOM in order to modify the HTML.</p></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">In other words, the content of the web page is stored in the DOM, and this content can be accessed and manipulated through the use of JavaScript.</p></br>
