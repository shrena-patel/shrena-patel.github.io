                <h4>Career pathway</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">My goal in terms of my career pathway is to start by gaining experience as a Junior Web/Front-End Developer, so I can learn as much as possible from others and get a real feel for what it’s like to work in the tech industry. Eventually, I would like to work more flexibly, possibly remotely, either for a company or for myself as a Web Developer.</p></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">I am also interested in helping people who typically aren’t drawn to the tech industry, to learn more about the industry and realise that it could be a viable career path for them. Once I have experience in the industry, I would like to get involved in community projects that teach coding to people who otherwise wouldn’t have access to a classroom or the technology to do so.</p></br>
              
                <h4>Human skills</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">Confidence in my abilities and the ability to communicate my thoughts and ideas in a clear way are the human skills I would like to develop whilst at EDA. I sometimes get nervous to speak in front of people, and as I result I struggle to get my words out properly, so this is something I want to work on over the next few months.</p></br>
              
                <h4>Strength and limitations</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">My strengths are that I’m a calm person, and as a result it takes a lot to get me annoyed. I am also self-aware, and empathetic.
                  One of my limitations, as mentioned before, would be my confidence in my abilities. This is something I am aware of and am actively working on.
                  </p></br>
          
                <h4>Managing the workload</h4></br>  
                  <p class="blog__para">I will manage my workload by setting daily goals so I keep on top of the learning competencies. I will also use Toggl and the Pomodoro technique to log my time and make sure I take enough breaks to keep my mind active and engaged.</p></br>
          
                <h4>Seeking help</h4></br>
                  <p class="blog__para">When I get stuck on an issue, I will use the framework we were given to methodically work through it. However when I get can’t work something out through my own research and I have spent say half an hour trying to work through the issue with no luck, I will ask for help from other EDA students or my facilitator.</p></br>
          
                <h4>Expectations</h4></br> 
                  <p class="blog__para">I expect the facilitation team to be open and friendly, which they definitely have been so far. I also expect them to give plenty of constructive feedback, so that I know where I’m going wrong or can improve, and can learn as much as possible from the bootcamp. </p></br>
