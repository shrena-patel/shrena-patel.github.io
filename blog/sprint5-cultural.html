                <h1 class="blog__title">Core Reflections</h1>
 
            <div class="blog__text">
                    <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">The first thing I have learned about myself and my ego is that I can be very self-critical and I compare myself to others who have more experience than me. I know logically that with practice I will get to a place where I feel more confident, but I still get that feeling of not being good enough from time to time.</p></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">I have also learned that I can and need to be okay with not knowing things. It is in fact a gift to not know something, because not knowing something means it’s something you can learn, and learning is always a positive thing.</p></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">Lastly, and most valuably, learning about neuroplasticity has given me the confidence to push through hard tasks and to know that it is possible for me to understand it, even though it may take a while to sink in.</p></br>
                    
                
                    <h4>What is the role of values, empathy and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">Your values, ability to empathise and self-awareness play a huge role in your day-to-day life, so naturally they have an impact on the way you learn and program.</p></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">Learning is a challenging but rewarding process, and if you come to it with the values of not being attached to a particular outcome or not wanting to always be right, your learning journey will feel like less of a struggle.</p></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">Similarly, if you approach programming with self-awareness, you are less likely to get stuck in your head and know when to seek help and assistance. Empathy with also allow you to recognise when someone else perhaps isn’t understanding something, and to help them without judgement.</p></br>
                   
                    <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">What surprised me the most was learning that companies don’t necessarily want to hire the most experienced coder, and that they would prefer a well-rounded person who maybe has less experience in coding.</p></br>
                        
                    <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4></br>   
                        <p class="blog__para">The most challenging part of the core learning was publishing my thoughts and feelings for others to see. I enjoy writing, and write in a journal most days, but the idea of letting other people read what I have written was a bit daunting. However, I have now learnt to let go of the fear, which is rather freeing.</p></br>
                        
                    <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4></br>   
                        <p class="blog__para">Because to function in the real world, you could have years and years of programming experience, but if you lack self-awareness, empathy or are generally just difficult human to work with, people aren’t going to want to hire you. The core learning has allowed us to look inwards and examine our strengths and weaknesses, and held us accountable for creating new positive habits, all of which are invaluable.</p></br>
                        
                    <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead?</h4></br>
                        <p class="blog__para">Not at all! I think it’s great that the course has a focus on core skills as well as tech skills. I thoroughly enjoyed learning more about the core topics, as they provided practical steps we can take to be more mindful and self-aware, such as journaling and creating good habits.</p></br>
